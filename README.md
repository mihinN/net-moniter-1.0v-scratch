This application can analyse your network traffic, and it can also manage your system. This shows incoming and outgoing traffic, network topology view, and server status (you can add one or more domains(ip address + port )). If you want to track your mail and identify where it came from or something, you can simply add your mail's metadata and analyse it too. <br><br>
